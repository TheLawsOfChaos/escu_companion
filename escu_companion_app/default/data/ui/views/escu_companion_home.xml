This only checks currently enabled detections, to prevent alerting on old stale copies.*\n          - *This alert can be configured to send emails, or anything else that is desired. By default it will create messages in the Splunk UI that can be seen by anyone with the `edit_correlationsearches` capability which by default is `ess_admin` and `admin`.*  "
